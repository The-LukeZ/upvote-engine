# Upvote Engine

> [!CAUTION]
> Top.gg webhooks currently only works for Legacy Webhooks since Top.gg revamped their webhooks system.

UpvoteEngine is a performant Discord vote handler built on a FaaS architecture using Cloudflare Workers.
This serverless approach ensures highly performant role management by automatically assigning and removing
roles based on top.gg votes with minimal latency and maximum scalability due to the services used.

## How it's done

- Cloudflare Worker built with Hono
  - Fetch handler by Hono
  - Queue handler native to Cloudflare Workers: This is used to process role assignments and removals asynchronously.

  - Cron Scheduler native to Cloudflare Workers: This is used to run periodic tasks like cleaning up old votes and invalid guilds.

- Webhook endpoint for top.gg vote notifications
- Cloudflare Queues for processing role assignments and removals
- @discordjs packages for Discord API interactions
  - @discordjs/rest
  - @discordjs/core
  - @discordjs/builders
  - @discordjs/collection
  - discord-api-types

## Notes

- When setting this up yourself, you need to modify the `wrangler.jsonc` file to include your own bindings, account_id, and other necessary configurations.
- Make sure to set up your database, environment variables, and queues as needed.

### TODO

- [ ] Cut down on Logs (only log errors and **really** important info) - currently there are about 60 logs in the whole project, which is excessive for production
